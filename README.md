## Testing

The test requires a local running ssh server with the ssh keys of the current
user added to its `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. In OS X, this is "Remote Login"
under the Sharing pref pane.

To run the full blown test suite use:

    bundle exec rake test

For faster release cycle use

    cd test_env
    bundle exec mina deploy --verbose
